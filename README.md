[Concordia](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia) is a library from Google DeepMind to facilitate construction and use of generative agent-based models to simulate interactions of agents in grounded physical, social, or digital space. It emphasises a game theoretic approach to modeling agents.

These are some experiments with it to test it out.

## TO-DO
- [ ] Use [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) to optimise the Concordia agents along the lines of [Automated Design of Agentic Systems](https://github.com/ShengranHu/ADAS)
